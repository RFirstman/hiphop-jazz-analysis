How M.E.D. hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Leave you with more holes than a dartboard
Haters watch him, Hennessy double shot drink
Like the answer to the problem's at the bottle's bottom
Uhh, from the bottom, top that homey, pay how you owe me
My niggas take no like Kobe
Even with the the arms of the Hulk, you couldn't hold me
From gettin mines, stogies be rolled, smokin and gettin by
Thanks to rap I ain't got a dime
Got me sneakin out of checkout lines with bottles by the waistside
Yeah, smack 'em in the face, let 'em taste pride
Face trial, end up washed up like the shorelines
Do or die ride, how the dead return
Street turns, keep me in this dirt like an earthworm
What he spit hits and grows, will brothers ever learn
Worth a word, chat with a nerd, meeting adjourned
