I would if I could but I ain't 'cause I cain't
Time for me to lay down the law. Who's raw?
You saw the views from the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a Cisco and you're like a cider: watery
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the G
To be stepped to, kept you on your toes
As my rep grew, I leapt through negative foes
So you better get flows to counteract what we've done
Received one good 'cause I'm armed like a sleeve, son
Plead dumb and step back as I wreck shop
Collect respect, props and deck the next prop artist
The hardest is the one who don't pass out
If Tyson's last name was Rophone, I'd knock his ass out
The bigger the better, the better the bigger is
Whenever you figure this nigga is gettin' his
Be real and don't kill with flaws the ill cause
Just answer to the boss
And that's when ya lost
Keep on losing, I'm using many tactics
I yearn to earn more green than Saint Patrick
And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n
