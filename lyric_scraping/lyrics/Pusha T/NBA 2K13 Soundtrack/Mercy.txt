Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins

My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence

Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like-
