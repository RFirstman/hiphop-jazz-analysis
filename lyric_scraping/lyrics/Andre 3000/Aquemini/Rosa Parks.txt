I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, "Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'"
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
Andr√©, got to her station, here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head
For hours, took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group
Ain't comin' with it, but I'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it
Anyway, but anyhow, when in doubt
Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
Sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, "It's weak" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, "Them niggas earned that crown", but until then
