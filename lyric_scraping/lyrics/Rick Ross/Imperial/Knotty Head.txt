Yeah, huh
Maybach Music
Found another body in the lake
Same day another tattoo on his face
Obituary on his mother's fireplace
Baby mother fuck another sucker on a blind date
Shots fired every night I'm tryna mind mine
Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline
Pussy niggas you can see it on his timeline
Hatin' on his dawg, shit I'm tryna find mine
Calm nigga, when I'm lit up I get Von Miller
Rich niggas if you real then you can run with us
Educated reading books I'm talkin Art of War
Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors
I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes
Came to put my city on that's if I'm right or wrong
Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars
And I'm thinking of my dawgs since I'm livin wrong
Jehovah's witness swear to God I done seen it all
Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark
You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off
D.C.C.C. we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Curry what's up! Double M
It's futuristic shit
