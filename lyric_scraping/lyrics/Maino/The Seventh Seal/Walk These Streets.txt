Yo, one for my comrades, two for my family
Three for the day that I run into my enemies
We gon' make a movie, the world gon' remember me
I survived it all dawg, what the hell you tellin me?
I remember days when, I was young and aidin
Cuttin class, chasin ass, couldn't pass grades and
Chillin on the block then, listenin to Rakim
Back of his album cliqued up with Killer Ben
Supreme Magnetic and I wasn't athletic
But I ran around with the Tre-8 Magnetic
Money on my mind, crack vials in my Levi's
Been a thug since I had the C.R.E.A.M. colored Filas
Yeah, yeah, we fly, seen it all with these eyes
Gunplay and drugs if you put my mind on rewind
Fast forward my life, ya boy done made it
If I could do it over, I wouldn't change it
