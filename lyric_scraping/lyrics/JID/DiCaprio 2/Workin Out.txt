Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, "Where the fuck you at?"
"On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back"
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too
Shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry cause I'm numb inside
If you wonder why, ask, "What's the matter?"

Shit, shit ain't really working out, huh
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working out, damn
Baby your ass fat, I can see you working out, shit
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead
