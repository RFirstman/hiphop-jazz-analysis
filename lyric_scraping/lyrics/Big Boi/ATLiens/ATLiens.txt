Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me
