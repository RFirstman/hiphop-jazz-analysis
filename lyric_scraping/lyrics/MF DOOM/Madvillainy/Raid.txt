How DOOM hold heat then preach non-violence?
Shhh, he about to start the speech, c'mon, silence
On one scary night, I saw the light
Heard a voice that sound like Barry White, said "Sho you right"
Don't let me find out who tried to bite
They better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
During tornado time with no coat than I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child up in a smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient "It's all in your imagination negro"
Ahh, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin', to date the Metal Fellow been rippin' flows
Since New York plates was ghetto yellow
With broke blue writing, this is too exciting
Folks leave out the show feelin' truly enlightened
They say "The Villain been spitting enough lightning
To rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton," alright, then
