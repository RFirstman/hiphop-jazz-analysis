As the plot thickens
It gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first littlel taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Olde E, I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas don' start bustin', "wham! wham!"
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation
