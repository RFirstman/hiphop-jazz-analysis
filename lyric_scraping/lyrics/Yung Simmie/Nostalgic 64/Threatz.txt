Never take kind to the threats
I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie
Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me?
Whole bunch of green in my Philly, turn up
Whole bunch of niggas if you run up
Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up
Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed
That's a one up, I'm a young gutta
Dog I mutter, Curry said cut 'em with his brudda
Leave them boys wet like water
Off with his neck, posted with the set
I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats
Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I'm good
Bust a nigga head for the cake
Jumping over gates can't wait
Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe
