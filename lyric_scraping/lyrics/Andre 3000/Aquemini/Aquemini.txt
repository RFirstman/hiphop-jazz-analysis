Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars, majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough
From scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast's Aquemini, another black experience
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin-André Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it-that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends
