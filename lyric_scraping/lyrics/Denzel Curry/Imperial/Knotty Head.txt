Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
But they got jacked like MK4
Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime
Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party
Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy
My pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz
Rico's Story when I see the coppers
Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition we made obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday, all of you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace
