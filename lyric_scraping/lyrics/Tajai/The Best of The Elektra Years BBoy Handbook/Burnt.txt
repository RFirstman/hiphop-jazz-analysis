I needs no sugar crisp to get swift
So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift? Tajai
I sense those who try to scale my ladder
Bladders release upon your porch if you don't cease
I respond with beats and will distraction
When I see one fatter than Rerun, so What's Happening?
It's not where you're from, it's just how you come
Correct, respect the roughneck 'cause 'nuff get
Bucked and tucked into their beds like "nighty, nighty"
Deft of the membrane, none left 'cause I am a righty
Fight these, you'll catch volleys for your follies and mistakes
I stick fakes with shanks, so no thanks
Wack shit, your attempts to rap are ineffectual
I get in butt styles like a hard-up homosexual
Not for sex when you're at the intersection of damage
Sandwich knuckles are what your luck pulls
Bad ones, catch one or two, rather a few
A slew for soft ass phonies plus your cronies
Try me, you'll catch my Vans in your hiney
That's if my back grip slips though I doubt it
Pout if you want to, covertly to find me
But I See's more than them Candies, nothing gets by me
So play the tracks, and you'll go out like Betamax
Next to Tajai 'cause I kicks the greater tracks
