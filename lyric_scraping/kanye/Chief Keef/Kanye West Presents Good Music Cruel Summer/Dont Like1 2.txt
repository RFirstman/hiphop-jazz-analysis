Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like (nah, nah)
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe (nah)
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!" (Sosa)
I don't want relations, I just want one night (one night)
'Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like (nah)
I got tats up on my arm 'cause this shit is life (that's life, tatted)
And I stunt so much in clothes 'cause I'm livin' life (life)
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right (300)
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like!
An-an-and bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight
