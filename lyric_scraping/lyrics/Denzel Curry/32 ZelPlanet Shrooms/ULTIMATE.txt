Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
Bitch, I'm ultimate, ultimate
Bitch, I'm...
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, "Is he fake? Is he real?"
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story
