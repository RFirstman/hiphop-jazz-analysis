Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't - you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!
