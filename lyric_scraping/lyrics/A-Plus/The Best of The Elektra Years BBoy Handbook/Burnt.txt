People call me souped just because I'm living fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads, leaving devils dead
Never said never 'cause a clever head's better
Dreads locked on the top of my crop, never flaky
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn't shake me
Bake me, Betty Crocker's oven isn't hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins then I got a lotta stuff
Not a bluff, got a tough guy thinkin' twice
Why step? 'Cause a fly rep, I kepts, my step ladder
I had a fatter spliff I was hittin' on
Now it's just a smidgen, like a pigeon, I'll be shittin' on
Sittin' on a futon, slippin' my Timb boots on
I'm the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on
Oops, I'm sorry 'cause I didn't mean to dis you
I could hook a ho and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb, Adam got a lotta dough
Need help with your garden? Skyline got a lotta hoes
Yo, I didn't mean hoes, yo, I meant women
If she got the pool, I got the trunks; let's go swimming
Dip, dip, dive 'cause I'm live
Liver than five or ten of the men on my jock, you don't stop
Here a pimp, there a pimp, everywhere a pimp pimp
This A-Plus grades the quiz, so there it is
