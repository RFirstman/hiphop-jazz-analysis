Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slapped stupid
East side little Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9-James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pep√© Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm astoundin', stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here
