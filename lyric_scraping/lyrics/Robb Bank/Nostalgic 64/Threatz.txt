Savage life nigga
You don't wanna see me live
Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe", man
I know your bitch love me
I know your bitch want me
She let me pillow pet that kitty
When she climb under this Snuggie
Bitch, South Florida
I only smoke mid in Broward
But end the flame of that Magic Dragon
And kill that Charmander, bitch
Gone on you niggas
Two phones on you niggas
Think I made it?
You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch
