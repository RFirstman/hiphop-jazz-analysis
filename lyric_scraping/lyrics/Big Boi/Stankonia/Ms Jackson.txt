My baby drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills-I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
Shit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday
I ain't invited, despite it
I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And I knew you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year two to the G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama
