I shouldn't let you explain, you should just let me explain
I see the games you be playing, it's really ice in your veins
It's kinda fucking insane, argue and power exchange?
I guess I'm out of my lane, I know I'm losing my brain
But I know it's hereditary, baby, 'cause your mama was a G
And your daddy wasn't there so you be tryna play with me, yeah
Shit, but, but that ain't the wave, yeah
But if I'm keeping it true, I know why I be this way now
We don't speak, we sit, eat food faced down
We don't sleep no more, we need space now
She gon' leave and go and her find her a bae now
Ouch, ouch, that's pain, yo, oh, so painful
Trying to change, just let me die in the rainfall
I can't save her if she don't want to be saved, how
Please, God, do something for me, God
She cut me deep just to see if I'ma bleed out
I know this ain't what I need, but who's to say what I need
What you say to your demons?
What you say when your heart is walking away with your feelings?
Ahhh, but didn't you know I tried, tried, tried, tried
Tried to be the guy in your life?
But you tied my soul, spirit, and mind
Been doing this all your life
Uh, okay, I remember all the better days
Used to spend a hella lot of time
Guessing something had got in the way
Guessing I was probably out of line
Then you said, "Don't speak to me"
I'd be like, "Okay, it's fine"
That's just gon' prolong the fight
Know that we said that if one of us upset
Then we just not gon' sleep tonight, aw, damn
Man, this shit has turned all bad
Call Mama, call Dad, call Izzy, call Precious, call Pat
Shit, it's like she spit in my face
And now the world's fallin' down on me
And I can't handle the weight
But I'm finna get medicated, maybe it'll take the pain away
A relationship will make you have a fucking revelation
But, but that ain't a waste, no
It's never been a waste of time, a waste of time, waste of time
