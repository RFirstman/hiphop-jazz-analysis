Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

She told me that I wasn't losing her, that she losing me
L-O-V, -E, we outta gas, I'll see you in a week
Thinking that, you won't fornicate with niggas that you meet
But silly me, now we are the same, Cupid admit defeat
Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine
You were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died
Idolized you when I didn't unite
You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now
