Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (woo)
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans, you can't stop a train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
(1-9-9-9) Anno Domini, anything goes, be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences are given for livin', the fence is
Too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell-hot
Get a life, now they on sale, then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ah!
