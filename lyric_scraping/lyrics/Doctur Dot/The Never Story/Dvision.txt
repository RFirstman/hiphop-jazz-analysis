I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck
