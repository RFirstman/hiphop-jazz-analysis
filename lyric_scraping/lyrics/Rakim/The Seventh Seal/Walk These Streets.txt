I perform in cities, hoods, and slums, the best seller is drugs
And money is the only thing that get love
They say don't let it make you, but that's how they rate you
And the more you got, the more they hate you (That's okay too)
Just don't get in the way, cause at the end of the day
My agenda's make sure I get them ends to get paid (uh-huh)
So I'm stackin grands 'til the math expand
It's the man with the master plan
Since a Bambino, cash made my path cross with evil
Uno dos cinco on a crowded corner rollin cee-lo
To chips and the chick in the casino pouring Clicquot
Cause now I make music for the c-notes
From New York to Puerto Rico, California to Rio
Hit the streets like the kilo but I'm legal
It's swag like I walk with heat though with all my people
But it's just me and my altered ego

(Ay, good lookin out my dude)
Aiyyo Maino, it's the same ol' same ol'
Don't matter if you in it for the fame or you lay low
Haters gon' hate but, it's okay though (Keep doin what you ddo)
The angle is make sure the payroll stay swoll
Big faces, cake dough and di-nay-ros
Rubles, yen yang, euros and pesos
Seven digit figures, tryna make more zay-ros
Spray holes in whoever in the way so (Stay outta my waaaay)
While I count the next bundle (that's right)
"All means necessary," Malcolm X hustle
A threat yet humble, about to flex muscle
Get a big amount then I'm in and out the next jungle
Cause every other day, I'm in another state
It's like I cross the thin line between love and hate
But I gotta eat, gotta get another plate
So I'm on my cake walk for the cake
