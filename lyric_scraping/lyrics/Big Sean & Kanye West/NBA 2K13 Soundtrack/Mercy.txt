Okay, drop it to the floor, make that ass shake (shake, shake...)
Woah, make the ground move: that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass: that's an ass-tate
Roll–roll–roll my weed on it: that's an ass tray
Say, Ye, say, Ye, don't we do this every day–day? (huh?)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a payday (huh?)
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin'
So much hate, I need a AK (AK)
Now we out in Paris, yeah, I'm Perrierin'
White girls politickin': that's that Sarah Palin
Get–get–get–get–get–gettin' hot, Californicatin'
I give her that D 'cause that's where I was born and raised in
