Uh, made it past twenty-five, I'm set, bitch, let me die (five, die)
Bet you respect me when I check in with that .45 (five)
Slide, ride, this a homicide, pull up to the side, let that man retire
I ain't Drake, this ain't 6ix, issa 9ine, sticky, blicky, iron (sticky)
Heard you fuck with swine? (Uh-huh) that ain't my kind
Fuck who you run to, keep it tucked, you know my chopper shy
When it cries, it cries, if you die, you die, pussy, meet the sky
Rappers telling lies (uh-huh) ACOG, too hard, write a hit like Akon
Heard you talking shit on Twitter, 40 make 'em log off
Know my presence makes you bitter, bitch, you better be cautious
It's nasty
