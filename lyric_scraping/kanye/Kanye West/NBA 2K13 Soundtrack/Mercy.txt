Okay, drop it to the floor, make that ass shake (shake, shake...)
Woah, make the ground move: that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass: that's an ass-tate
Roll–roll–roll my weed on it: that's an ass tray
Say, Ye, say, Ye, don't we do this every day–day? (huh?)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a payday (huh?)
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin'
So much hate, I need a AK (AK)
Now we out in Paris, yeah, I'm Perrierin'
White girls politickin': that's that Sarah Palin
Get–get–get–get–get–gettin' hot, Californicatin'
I give her that D 'cause that's where I was born and raised in

Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)
