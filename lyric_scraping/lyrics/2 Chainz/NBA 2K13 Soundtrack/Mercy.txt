Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (rain) pourin' (pourin')
All my cars is foreign (foreign)
All my broads is foreign (foreign)
Money tall like Jordan
