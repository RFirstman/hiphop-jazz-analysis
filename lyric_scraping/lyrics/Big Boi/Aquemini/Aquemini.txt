Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks
You bust rhyme, we bust back
Get-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and  Gemini runnin' shit like this
