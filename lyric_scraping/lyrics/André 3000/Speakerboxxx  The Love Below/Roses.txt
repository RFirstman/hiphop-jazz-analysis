Caroline (Caroline), see, Caroline
All the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, haha, yeah

Caroline, (Caroline), see
She's the reason for the word 'bitch' (bitch)
I hope she's speedin' on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to a baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash
Crash into a ditch (Just playin')
She needs a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it takes to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah
