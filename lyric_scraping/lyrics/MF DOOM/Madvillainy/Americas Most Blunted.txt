Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the bar-code
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or sit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black & Mild
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop-n-Go Mart, actin like a spirit host done it
"America's most blunted!"
Yeah, yo
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha-ed, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beat-box
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it
