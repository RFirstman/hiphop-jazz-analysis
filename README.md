# Hip Hop/Jazz Analysis

This repository tracks my work for Georgia Tech's Robotic Musicianship VIP team for the Spring 2019 semester.
This semester, I am working to create tools for automated rhyme scheme analysis.

## Contents

`lyric_scraping/` contains code for a python script that collects verses from given artists using the 
[LyricsGenius](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius) python library

`nltk_rhyme.py` and `words_rhyme.py` are small scripts I wrote to test out two python libraries, 
[NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and [Jellyfish](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish), respectively.
