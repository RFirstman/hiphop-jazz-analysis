Sce-beep-boop
Bob your head to this, mischievous, soul societal
Idle chatter never slips off the lips of this writer
Might not be the greater innovator of the rhyme scheme
My style is the Visine to get your eyes opening
This Raggedy Andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle
You're hip-to-the-hop I kick; I trip the light fantastic
Gettin' into the groove better than a phonographic
The vandal with the vocals making the locals go insane
The regal rhymer speaks sustenance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases as you praise us like divinity
The one of liberated soul controls for infinity
Got style by the square mile, cats got a vibe child
Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech
And peace to prop prophets as I ponder and teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent
Listen, pay attention, I'm the master of this convention
Kick the wicked-and-wiley-styley while you're stuttering just like Smiley
Skipping shingles of your shattered dreams, too bad it seems you tried me
The wise and wordy wizard pays a visit to your subconscious
Crush your wonderland, extinguish all the nonsense
Optimistic, stylistic, mystic myth, I'm swift
Like Mercury, mercy me, I'll surely shoot the gift
