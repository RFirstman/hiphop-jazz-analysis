Niggas ain't seein' you Venus, shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills, my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my delivery
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine nigga
Hah, now elevate my status to Gucci bags
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And yes them things gon' flash if you want to act up
