Put your black ass in a duffle bag
And slide off in the hopes, it's a closed casket
My presence alone can exterminate masses
The tongue speak spells, cause blazing rashes
Like who gonna go and betray the beast?
Like who gonna go and start war with me?
Nigga, who gonna go and betray the Zii?
Godzilla (wardogs!), go start a feast
It's the wardog, sup (wassup)
Five-star general, ten-hut (wassup)
In the bottom of hell I, clutch (wassup)
Hands covered in blood and, rust (wassup)
No nigga can take my, soul (wassup)
Drop dead, them heads will, roll (wassup)
We'll drop the corpse in the cold (wassup)
War dog, I'll stick to the code (wassup)
Ayy, now I'm muddy booted, redrumin'
Body baggin', head huntin', police siren, fence jumping
Black metal, gun bustin'
Wardog bitch, we gon' tape up our fists
We the wardogs bitch, wear our rank on our wrist (woo!)
