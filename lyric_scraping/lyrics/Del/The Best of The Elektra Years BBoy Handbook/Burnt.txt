Mista, twista, getcha
Every single time and I rhyme like I know so I flow
With the gifted tongue and the cryptic brung
New phrases into the mazes
Play this
Two times a day with the day-o
Day-ay-ayo and the daylight come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee in the ears of my peers
So they know, and I know, we all know, day-o
Daylight come and me wanna go home
Cool
No tool, no Smith and Wesson
Just an opposite so I can pop a bit of
Shit on the mic when I get on the mic
"B-b-b-bam!" I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it, just like the girl on Ahonetwo
D-E-L will C-R-U-S-H anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito
Veto is the answer when I prance upon your skull like a Frito
Finito, but I ain't finished
'Til I let the flipside ride 'til the rhythm is diminished
