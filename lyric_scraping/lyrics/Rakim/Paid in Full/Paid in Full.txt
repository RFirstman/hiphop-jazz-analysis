Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nothin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin', "How could I get some dead presidents?"
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smilin', be still, don't nothing move, but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, If I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin' this
Feeling out of place, 'cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full
