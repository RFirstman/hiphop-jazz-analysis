I done sold purp (purple), I done sold white (white)
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like (nah)
She never let me hit it (nah), she gave me dome twice (haha)
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother thirty for the Jesus (uh-huh)
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!
